# moweb.dev-url-shortener

Hey!

I'm using a ```_redirects``` file in this repo to create URL shorteners for myself. I host this repo on netlify and got a domain I route this through.

The domain I bought is https://moweb.dev/ and navigating to https://moweb.dev/portfolio will bring you to my main portfolio.

This way, I can share links easier with other people, as my regular website has a rather long name (thanks mom and dad!).

Interested? You can follow along with the same video I used here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6paXyx6hM
